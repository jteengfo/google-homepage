## Reflection

### June 30, 2021

#### I asked for help and tips in TOP discord and I have learned that the right way to construct a webpage is the following:
    1. Build html blocks on the webpage
    2. Convert them into semantic html blocks (elements with meaning)
    3. Apply CSS styling
#### This is very useful to me because it lays out the fundamentals as well as creates a step-by-step procedure that is easily followed.

#### I have finished replicating the google homepage! I FEEL ACCOMPLISHED! It made me realize how much things are going on just to produce a simple webpage like google search page as I have initially perceived. 

#### There were a lot of trial and error that I had to go through just to make things work BUT it was definitely worth it. I did use the inspect tool A LOT and it made me realize how truly useful and important the tool was.
