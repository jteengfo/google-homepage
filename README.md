'''bash
I asked for help and tips in TOP discord and I have learned that the right way to construct a webpage is the following:
    1. Build html blocks on the webpage
    2. Convert them into semantic html blocks (elements with meaning)
    3. Apply CSS styling
This is very useful to me because it lays out the fundamentals as well as creates a step-by-step procedure that is easily followed.
